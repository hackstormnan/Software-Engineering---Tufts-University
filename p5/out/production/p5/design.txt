# Write down your multi-threading designs here!

I write two loops to get every train and every passenger respectively
I also assign a unique lock to each station.

For the train move, I first lock the station where train at, then when train is moving,
I lock the train. Then, when the train arrive at the next station, I unlock the previous station
and lock the station that train just move to, and unlock the train.

For the passenger, I give passenger a field: train recording which train the passenger is currently at.
If the passenger is at the station, train is null. When train is null, the passenger waiting for the right train.
When passenger board, the lock on this right train is unlock. When the passenger is on the train, this train is locked
and when the train arrive to the next station that passenger want to go, the passenger deboard and the train is unlocked.

There is also a lock, to protect the count that will record how many passengers finish their trips. When all
passengers finish their trips, the train generally stops.

I let the train sleep for 200ms when they arrive at the stations to increase the program's running speed.
